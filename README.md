Tech Stack & Architecture
The app is built using modern, Google-recommended best practices to ensure high performance and a maintainable codebase.

Programming Languages: Kotlin (primary) and Java.

Architecture: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel).

Jetpack Libraries:

ViewModel: To manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.

LiveData: For building observable, data-driven UIs.

RecyclerView: For displaying large lists efficiently.

ViewBinding: For safer interaction between code and XML layouts.

Asynchronous Programming: Kotlin Coroutines for managing background tasks smoothly.

Networking: Retrofit & OkHttp for fetching data from the internet (e.g., prayer times).

Data Source:

Local JSON Files: For storing Quran, Hadith, and Azkar data (works offline).

Remote API: For fetching dynamic data (e.g., prayer times from api.aladhan.com).
