üèõÔ∏è App Architecture & Technical Details
The application is built following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to ensure organized code, separation of concerns, and to facilitate future maintenance and development.

Programming Languages: The app is developed using a mix of Kotlin for modern features and Java for some legacy components.

Data Source: The app uses a hybrid model:

Local Data: Quran, Azkar, and Hadith data are stored in JSON files within the app's assets folder. This ensures that these core features work perfectly offline.

Remote Data: Prayer times are fetched dynamically from an external API (api.aladhan.com) using the Retrofit library.

State & Data Management: ViewModel and LiveData are used to efficiently manage UI-related data and its state.

Location Services:

For Prayer Times: FusedLocationProviderClient is used to get the user's precise location.

For Qibla: LocationManager is used in conjunction with device sensors (ACCELEROMETER, MAGNETIC_FIELD).
